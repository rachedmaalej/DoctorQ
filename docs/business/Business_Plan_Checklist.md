## Overview

This document transforms the draft business plan into an actionable checklist. Complete each phase sequentially to build a solid, evidence-based business plan that addresses all critical weaknesses identified in the initial draft.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- ✅ Real customer validation data (not assumptions)
- ✅ Proven unit economics from pilot clinic (YOUR COUSIN'S PRACTICE)
- ✅ Realistic financial projections with conservative assumptions
- ✅ Clear competitive moat and differentiation
- ✅ Operational execution plan with technical dependencies mapped

---

## Phase 1: Customer Discovery & Problem Validation (Weeks 1-2)

### Objective
Validate the problem statement with quantitative evidence from real doctors and patients. **START WITH YOUR COUSIN** as the first interview to refine your questions.

### 🎯 1.0 Pilot Clinic Baseline (Your Cousin's Practice) - DO THIS FIRST

#### Initial Baseline Interview with Your Cousin
- [ ] **Schedule 60-minute baseline meeting** with your cousin (NOT just 30 min - this is your pilot!)
- [ ] **Document his practice specifics:**
  - Patients per day (average, min, max)
  - Current wait times (average, worst case)
  - Receptionist situation (dedicated? part-time? him alone?)
  - Current check-in process (paper notebook? nothing?)
  - Patient demographics (age range, tech-savviness estimate)
  - How he communicates with patients (SMS? WhatsApp? Phone calls?)
  - Biggest pain points with current queue management
- [ ] **Ask him to commit to specific pilot parameters:**
  - Start date (when can we launch MVP?)
  - Duration (recommend 3-4 weeks minimum)
  - Success criteria from HIS perspective (what would make him want to pay 60 TND/month?)
  - His receptionist's availability for 15-min training
  - Permission to survey his patients during pilot
- [ ] **Technical requirements:**
  - WiFi availability in waiting room (for QR code scanning)
  - Can we put QR poster on wall? Where?
  - Can receptionist use computer/tablet during consultations?
- [ ] **Set expectations:**
  - You'll fix bugs within 24 hours during pilot
  - You'll be available via WhatsApp for support
  - Weekly check-in meetings (15 min) during pilot
  - He gets lifetime free access as thanks for being first

#### Deliverable from Cousin Interview
- [ ] **Create "Pilot Clinic Profile"** (1 page):
  - Practice details (patient volume, wait times, current process)
  - Baseline metrics (to compare before/after)
  - Pilot start date and duration
  - Success criteria
  - Technical setup requirements

**⚡ KEY ADVANTAGE:** Use insights from your cousin to refine interview questions for other doctors. He's your "free consultant" before you talk to strangers.

## Phase 2: Competitive Analysis & Positioning (Weeks 2-4)

### Objective
Deeply understand competitors and define clear differentiation.

### 2.1 Competitor Research

#### Direct Competitors (Virtual Queue Systems)
- [ ] Research Qless (international)
- [ ] Research QLess Tunisia (if exists)
- [ ] Research Waitwhile
- [ ] Research local Tunisian practice management software (e.g., DoctorDz, MediSoft)
- [ ] Search for "file d'attente virtuelle tunisie" and document all results

#### For Each Competitor, Document:
- [ ] **Pricing:** Monthly cost, setup fees, per-SMS costs
- [ ] **Features:** What do they offer vs what we offer?
- [ ] **Target market:** Hospitals vs clinics? Multi-doctor vs solo?
- [ ] **Technology:** App-based or web-based? SMS or app-only?
- [ ] **Local presence:** Do they operate in Tunisia? Support in French/Arabic?
- [ ] **Weaknesses:** Where do they fall short?

#### Indirect Competitors (Current Practices)
- [ ] **Paper notebook:** Cost = 0 TND, features = none, weaknesses = no visibility
- [ ] **WhatsApp manual messages:** Cost = 0 TND, features = receptionist sends manual updates, weaknesses = time-consuming
- [ ] **No system:** Cost = 0 TND, features = patients just wait, weaknesses = maximum frustration

### 2.2 Differentiation Matrix

#### Create Comparison Table
- [ ] Build table comparing DoctorQ vs 3 top competitors on:
  - Price (setup + monthly + per-SMS)
  - Tunisia-specific (local SMS rates, Arabic support, local support)
  - Ease of use (receptionist training time, patient tech requirements)
  - Features (QR check-in, WhatsApp, real-time updates, analytics)
  - Target customer (solo doctors vs clinics vs hospitals)

#### Unique Value Proposition (UVP) Checklist
- [ ] Identify 3 things DoctorQ does better than ALL competitors
- [ ] Identify 1-2 things DoctorQ does that NO competitor offers
- [ ] Validate UVP with 5 doctors: "Would these differences matter to you?"

#### Evidence Deliverable
- [ ] Create "Competitive Analysis" (3-4 pages) with:
  - Competitor comparison table
  - Market gaps identified
  - DoctorQ's unique positioning
  - Competitive moat (why we'll win)
  - Pricing justification vs competitors

### 2.3 Pricing Validation

#### Pricing Experiments
- [ ] Test 3 price points with different doctor segments:
  - Low volume (<15 patients/day): 40 TND test
  - Medium volume (15-30 patients/day): 60 TND test
  - High volume (>30 patients/day): 80 TND test
- [ ] Ask: "Would you pay [price] for this solution?" (Yes/No/Maybe)
- [ ] Ask: "What price would be too expensive? Too cheap to trust?"
- [ ] Calculate Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity (optimal price point)

#### Value-Based Pricing Calculation
- [ ] Calculate patient time saved: [avg wait reduction] × [patients/day] × [patient time value]
- [ ] Calculate receptionist time saved: [interruptions avoided] × [time per interruption] × [hourly wage]
- [ ] Calculate patient retention value: [patients who don't leave] × [revenue per patient]
- [ ] Total value delivered per month: Sum above
- [ ] Pricing strategy: Charge 10-20% of value delivered

#### Evidence Deliverable
- [ ] Create "Pricing Strategy" (2 pages) with:
  - Validated price point (60 TND or adjusted based on data)
  - Price sensitivity analysis
  - Value justification (ROI for doctors)
  - Competitor price comparison
  - Pricing tiers (if applicable: solo vs multi-doctor)

---

## Phase 3: Pilot Program Execution (Weeks 2-6)

### Objective
Execute a 3-4 week pilot with YOUR COUSIN'S ophthalmology practice to validate product-market fit and calculate real unit economics.

### 🎯 3.1 Pilot Clinic: YOUR COUSIN'S PRACTICE (Already Secured!)

**✅ MAJOR ADVANTAGE:** You already have a committed pilot clinic. This eliminates recruitment risk and accelerates timeline.

#### Pilot Agreement with Your Cousin
- [ ] **Create simple 1-page pilot agreement** covering:
  - Duration: 3-4 weeks (confirm specific dates)
  - Free access during pilot + lifetime free as thanks
  - Commitment to use system for ALL patients during pilot (not just some)
  - Permission to collect usage data and survey patients
  - Weekly 15-min check-in meetings (in person or video)
  - Your commitment: Fix bugs within 24 hours, available via WhatsApp
  - Success criteria: Define what "success" means to him
  - Honest feedback: He promises to tell you what DOESN'T work
- [ ] **Get signature** (can be digital/WhatsApp - just need commitment)

#### Ophthalmology Practice Profile
- [ ] Document baseline (from Phase 1.0 interview):
  - Patient volume per day (avg, min, max)
  - Current wait times (avg, worst case)
  - Current process (paper, nothing, other)
  - Receptionist details (name, tech comfort level, availability for training)
  - Patient demographics (age range, tech-savviness)

**📊 Why Ophthalmology is GREAT for pilot:**
- ✅ High patient volume (eye doctors often see 20-40 patients/day)
- ✅ Consultations vary in length (some quick, some long = variable wait times)
- ✅ Patients of all ages (tests system with diverse demographics)
- ✅ Often have receptionist (critical for queue management)

#### Optional: Add 1-2 More Pilot Clinics (If Time Allows)
**RECOMMENDATION:** Start with JUST your cousin for first 2 weeks. If it goes well, add 1-2 more clinics for weeks 3-4 to diversify data.

- [ ] Identify 2-3 candidate clinics from customer discovery interviews (only if cousin's pilot is going well)
- [ ] Prioritize by: Different specialty (e.g., Pediatrics or General Medicine), enthusiastic doctor, willing receptionist
- [ ] Pitch: "We're already piloting with Dr. [Cousin's Name] (Ophthalmology) with great results. Want to join?"
- [ ] Only add if you can handle support for multiple clinics simultaneously

### 3.2 Pilot Success Metrics

#### Define Metrics to Track
- [ ] **Usage metrics:**
  - Patients checked in per day (avg)
  - % of patients using QR vs manual vs WhatsApp
  - SMS delivery success rate (target: >95%)
  - Patient status page views (engagement)
- [ ] **Satisfaction metrics:**
  - Doctor NPS (Net Promoter Score) - ask weekly
  - Receptionist satisfaction (scale 1-10) - ask weekly
  - Patient satisfaction (survey 20 patients per clinic)
- [ ] **Operational metrics:**
  - Average wait time before vs after DoctorQ
  - Receptionist interruptions before vs after
  - No-show rate before vs after
  - Patients who left due to wait before vs after
- [ ] **Business metrics:**
  - Would clinic pay 60 TND/month after trial? (Yes/No)
  - Referral likelihood (would they recommend to peers?)
  - Feature requests (top 5)

### 3.3 Pilot Execution Plan

#### Pre-Launch (Week 0)
- [ ] Develop MVP: QR check-in, manual add, patient status page, SMS notifications (queue joined, almost turn, your turn)
- [ ] Set up Twilio with Tunisian SMS sending number
- [ ] Create QR code posters for each clinic (A4 printable)
- [ ] Prepare receptionist training materials (15-minute video + 1-page quick guide)
- [ ] Set up analytics dashboard to track all metrics

#### Week 1: Onboarding
- [ ] Install QR posters at each clinic
- [ ] Train receptionists (15 min in-person or Zoom)
- [ ] Test SMS delivery with 3 test patients per clinic
- [ ] Set up daily check-in calls (5 min) for first 3 days
- [ ] Monitor for technical issues closely

#### Week 2-3: Active Monitoring
- [ ] Daily: Check SMS delivery rates, error logs
- [ ] Every 2 days: WhatsApp check-in with receptionists ("Any issues?")
- [ ] Weekly: 15-min call with each doctor (feedback, satisfaction)
- [ ] Collect feature requests and pain points
- [ ] Fix bugs within 24 hours

#### Week 4: Data Collection & Interviews
- [ ] Send patient satisfaction survey (20 patients per clinic)
- [ ] Conduct 30-min exit interview with each doctor
- [ ] Conduct 15-min exit interview with each receptionist
- [ ] Ask: "Would you pay 60 TND/month to keep using this?" (record answer)
- [ ] Ask: "What would make this a 10/10 product?"
- [ ] Export all usage data from analytics dashboard

### 3.4 Pilot Analysis

#### Calculate Real Metrics
- [ ] **Product-Market Fit Score:** % of clinics who would pay after trial (target: >60%)
- [ ] **Average patients per clinic per day:** [total check-ins] / [clinics] / [days]
- [ ] **Engagement rate:** [patients who opened status page] / [total check-ins] (target: >70%)
- [ ] **SMS costs per clinic:** [total SMS sent] × [cost per SMS] (validate 9 TND/month assumption)
- [ ] **Wait time reduction:** Average wait before - average wait after (target: >20% reduction)
- [ ] **Receptionist time saved:** [interruptions avoided] × [time per interruption] (target: >1 hour/day)
- [ ] **Patient satisfaction increase:** NPS or satisfaction score improvement
- [ ] **Conversion rate:** % willing to pay 60 TND (target: >50%)

#### Evidence Deliverable
- [ ] Create "Pilot Program Report" (5-7 pages) with:
  - **Clinic profile: Dr. [Cousin's Name], Ophthalmology** (can use real name with permission, or anonymize)
  - Usage metrics with charts (patients/day, SMS sent, status page views)
  - **Before/after comparison** (CRITICAL - this is your proof):
    - Wait times: Was [X] min avg, now [Y] min avg
    - Receptionist interruptions: Was [X] times/day, now [Y] times/day
    - Patient complaints: Was [X]/week, now [Y]/week
  - SMS cost validation (actual TND spent during pilot ÷ days ÷ avg patients/day)
  - **Doctor testimonial from your cousin** (ask for honest quote - family honesty is valuable!)
  - **Receptionist testimonial** (their perspective is critical for other clinics)
  - Patient testimonials (3-5 quotes from surveyed patients)
  - Conversion rate: Would your cousin pay 60 TND/month? (His answer matters for pricing validation)
  - Top feature requests (what your cousin wishes existed)
  - Lessons learned and product improvements needed

#### 🎯 Post-Pilot: Leverage Your Cousin for Sales
- [ ] **Ask your cousin for video testimonial** (30 seconds, on smartphone):
  - "I'm Dr. [Name], ophthalmologist in [Location]. We tested DoctorQ for 4 weeks. Our patients loved seeing their position in real time, and my receptionist saved X hours per week. I'm keeping it."
- [ ] **Ask permission to use his name in sales** pitches:
  - "We're already working with Dr. [Cousin's Name] at [Clinic Name] with excellent results"
  - This is HUGE social proof for next 10 clinics
- [ ] **Ask for 2-3 referrals** from his doctor friends:
  - "Do you know 2-3 doctors who might also benefit from this?"
  - Warm intros beat cold calls 10:1

---

## Phase 4: Financial Model Development (Weeks 4-6)

### Objective
Build a realistic, evidence-based financial model with conservative assumptions.

### 4.1 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Calculation

**🎯 MAJOR ADVANTAGE:** Your cousin is clinic #1, so your CAC for him = ~0 TND (family favor). This dramatically improves your early unit economics!

#### Marketing Channel Experiments

**START WITH LOWEST CAC CHANNELS FIRST** (you have proof from pilot now):

- [ ] **Channel 1: Referrals from Your Cousin (LOWEST CAC!)**
  - Ask your cousin for 2-3 doctor friends who might be interested
  - Pitch with social proof: "Dr. [Cousin] has been using this for a month with great results"
  - Track: Referrals received, conversion rate
  - Calculate: CAC = [1 month free value as incentive] ÷ [conversion rate]
  - **Expected CAC: 20-60 TND per clinic** (cheapest channel!)

- [ ] **Channel 2: Direct Sales with Pilot Proof (Door-to-door)**
  - Visit 20 clinics in person with 5-min pitch + pilot results
  - Bring 1-page case study: "Dr. [Cousin], Ophthalmology, reduced wait times by X%"
  - Track: Hours spent, conversion rate, cost (travel, time)
  - Calculate: CAC = [hours × hourly rate + travel] ÷ [clinics signed]
  - **Expected CAC: 200-400 TND per clinic** (with pilot proof, better than cold)

- [ ] **Channel 3: LinkedIn Outreach with Testimonial**
  - Message 50 doctors on LinkedIn with personalized pitch
  - Include: "We're working with Dr. [Cousin's Name] (Ophthalmology) - here's what he said: [quote]"
  - Track: Time spent, conversion rate to demo, demo-to-signup rate
  - Calculate: CAC = [hours × hourly rate] ÷ [clinics signed]
  - **Expected CAC: 150-300 TND per clinic**

- [ ] **Channel 4: Facebook Ads (ONLY if other channels don't work)**
  - Run small ad campaign (100-200 TND budget) targeting doctors
  - Ad creative: Screenshot of pilot results + "Join Dr. [Name] using DoctorQ"
  - Track: Ad spend, clicks, demo bookings, signups
  - Calculate: CAC = [ad spend + time cost] ÷ [clinics signed]
  - **Expected CAC: 300-600 TND per clinic** (highest CAC, test last)

#### CAC Targets by Phase
- [ ] **Pilot phase (manual):** 500-1000 TND per clinic (acceptable, high-touch)
- [ ] **Early growth (10-20 clinics):** 300-500 TND per clinic
- [ ] **Scale (50+ clinics):** <200 TND per clinic (optimize channels)

#### Evidence Deliverable
- [ ] Create "CAC Analysis" (2 pages) with:
  - Cost per clinic acquired by channel
  - Conversion funnel metrics (pitch → demo → signup)
  - Recommended primary channel for first 20 clinics
  - Plan to reduce CAC over time

### 4.2 Churn Rate Validation

#### Historical Churn Research
- [ ] Interview 3 competitors or similar SaaS businesses in Tunisia
- [ ] Ask: "What's your monthly churn rate for small business customers?"
- [ ] Research industry benchmarks for SMB SaaS (typical: 3-7% monthly)
- [ ] Analyze pilot clinics: Would any cancel after 1 month? Why?

#### Churn Assumption
- [ ] **Conservative model:** 5% monthly churn (realistic for SMB SaaS)
- [ ] **Base case model:** 3% monthly churn (if strong product-market fit)
- [ ] **Optimistic model:** 2% monthly churn (best case)

### 4.3 Revenue Projections (12 Months)

#### Monthly Revenue Model Spreadsheet
- [ ] Create Excel/Google Sheets with columns:
  - Month | New Clinics | Total Clinics | Churned | Active Clinics | MRR | Cumulative Revenue
- [ ] **Assumptions to input:**
  - Starting clinics: [pilot clinics who convert]
  - New clinics per month: [based on sales capacity]
  - Churn rate: 3-5% monthly
  - Price: 60 TND per clinic
- [ ] Model 3 scenarios:
  - **Conservative:** 2 new clinics/month, 5% churn → 14 clinics by month 12
  - **Base case:** 4 new clinics/month, 3% churn → 35 clinics by month 12
  - **Optimistic:** 6 new clinics/month, 2% churn → 60 clinics by month 12

#### Revenue Milestones
- [ ] Calculate months to reach:
  - 10 clinics (breakeven on variable costs only)
  - 25 clinics (covers fixed costs)
  - 50 clinics (profitable with salary for founder)
  - 100 clinics (viable business)

### 4.4 Cost Structure (Fixed + Variable)

#### Fixed Costs (Monthly) - Detailed Breakdown
- [ ] **Hosting & Infrastructure:**
  - Frontend hosting (Vercel): 20 USD/month
  - Backend hosting (Railway): 20 USD/month
  - Database (PostgreSQL hosted): 15 USD/month
  - Domain & SSL: 2 USD/month
  - Total hosting: ~57 USD/month (~180 TND)
- [ ] **External Services:**
  - Twilio account fees: 0 TND (pay-per-SMS only)
  - Monitoring (Sentry): 0 TND (free tier)
  - Email service (SendGrid): 0 TND (free tier)
- [ ] **Labor (if applicable):**
  - Founder salary: 0 TND initially, 1500 TND after month 6 (if viable)
  - Part-time developer (optional): 800 TND/month
  - Customer support (self initially): 0 TND
- [ ] **Marketing & Sales:**
  - Paid ads budget: 200 TND/month (after pilot)
  - Sales materials (QR posters, flyers): 50 TND/month
- [ ] **Miscellaneous:**
  - Accounting/legal: 100 TND/month
  - Software licenses (design tools, etc.): 50 TND/month

#### Total Fixed Costs
- [ ] **Minimal scenario (bootstrapped):** 380 TND/month (hosting + marketing + misc)
- [ ] **With part-time dev:** 1,180 TND/month
- [ ] **With founder salary:** 2,680 TND/month

#### Variable Costs (Per Clinic Per Month)
- [ ] **SMS costs:**
  - Average SMS per clinic: [from pilot data - assume 300 messages/month]
  - Cost per SMS in Tunisia: [research local provider - assume 0.03 TND]
  - Total SMS cost per clinic: 300 × 0.03 = 9 TND/month
- [ ] **Customer support time:**
  - Average support hours per clinic: [from pilot - assume 0.5 hours/month]
  - Cost of support time: [hourly rate × hours - assume 20 TND/hour × 0.5 = 10 TND]
- [ ] **Infrastructure scaling:**
  - Database cost increase per 10 clinics: ~5 USD/month (~15 TND)

#### Total Variable Cost Per Clinic
- [ ] 9 TND (SMS) + 10 TND (support) + 1.5 TND (infrastructure) = **20.5 TND per clinic**

### 4.5 Unit Economics

#### Contribution Margin per Clinic
- [ ] **Revenue per clinic:** 60 TND/month
- [ ] **Variable cost per clinic:** 20.5 TND/month
- [ ] **Contribution margin:** 60 - 20.5 = **39.5 TND per clinic** (66% margin)

#### CAC Payback Period
- [ ] **If CAC = 400 TND:**
  - Payback period = 400 / 39.5 = **10 months**
- [ ] **Target:** Reduce CAC to achieve <12 month payback

#### LTV:CAC Ratio
- [ ] **Calculate LTV (Lifetime Value):**
  - Average customer lifetime = 1 / churn rate = 1 / 0.03 = 33 months
  - LTV = 33 months × 39.5 TND = **1,303 TND**
- [ ] **LTV:CAC Ratio:**
  - 1,303 TND / 400 TND = **3.3:1** (healthy ratio, target >3:1)

### 4.6 Break-Even Analysis

#### Break-Even Calculation
- [ ] **Fixed costs:** 380 TND/month (minimal scenario)
- [ ] **Contribution margin per clinic:** 39.5 TND
- [ ] **Break-even clinics (ignoring CAC):** 380 / 39.5 = **10 clinics**
- [ ] **Break-even clinics (including CAC payback):**
  - If acquiring 4 clinics/month at 400 TND CAC = 1,600 TND/month acquisition cost
  - Need enough contribution margin to cover both fixed (380) + CAC (1,600) = 1,980 TND
  - 1,980 / 39.5 = **50 clinics** to break even during growth phase

#### Time to Break-Even
- [ ] **Base case scenario:** 4 new clinics/month, 3% churn
  - Month to reach 50 active clinics: ~14 months
- [ ] **Conservative scenario:** 2 new clinics/month, 5% churn
  - Month to reach 50 active clinics: ~28 months

### 4.7 Cash Flow Projections

#### Monthly Cash Flow Spreadsheet (12 months)
- [ ] Create columns: Month | Revenue | Fixed Costs | Variable Costs | CAC Spend | Net Cash Flow | Cumulative Cash
- [ ] Model starting cash: [investment or personal funds - assume 5,000 TND]
- [ ] Track cumulative cash to identify:
  - Months with negative cash flow (funding needed)
  - Total cash burn before breakeven
  - Runway (months until cash runs out)

#### Funding Requirements
- [ ] **Bootstrap scenario:** Can you reach 10 clinics without external funding?
  - Required cash: [cumulative negative cash flow] + [buffer 2,000 TND]
- [ ] **Raise scenario:** If raising 20,000 TND, what milestones can you hit?
  - Target: 50 clinics in 12 months, then profitable

  - **Likelihood:** Low (large informal medical market in Tunisia)
  - **Impact:** High (limits growth potential)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Research addressable market size with hard data (medical association registries)
    - Expand to adjacent markets (dentists, physical therapists, other cities)
    - Pivot to multi-doctor clinics if needed

### 7.2 Product Risks

#### Risk Matrix
- [ ] **Risk 1: Patients don't use the system (low adoption of QR codes)**
  - **Likelihood:** Medium (tech literacy varies)
  - **Impact:** High (no value delivered to doctors)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Pilot data validation: Track % of patients who scan QR vs manual add
    - Offer manual check-in as fallback (receptionist enters phone)
    - Add WhatsApp check-in (just send message, no QR needed)
    - Ensure SMS-only experience works (no app required)
- [ ] **Risk 2: SMS costs are higher than expected**
  - **Likelihood:** Medium (variable by provider and volume)
  - **Impact:** Medium (eats into margins)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Pilot validation: Calculate actual SMS per clinic per month
    - Negotiate volume discounts with Twilio or local provider
    - Migrate 80% of users to WhatsApp (cheaper per message)
    - Set SMS limits per clinic (e.g., max 500/month)
- [ ] **Risk 3: Technical reliability issues (downtime, bugs)**

  - **Likelihood:** High (if growth accelerates)
  - **Impact:** Medium (service quality drops, churn increases)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Build self-service knowledge base (FAQ, videos)
    - Hire part-time support agent at 30 clinics
    - Automate common support tasks (password resets, QR regeneration)
    - Set clear support hours and SLAs
- [ ] **Risk 2: Founder burnout (wearing too many hats)**
  - **Likelihood:** High (solo founder, multiple roles)
  - **Impact:** High (business stalls or fails)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Outsource non-core tasks (accounting, design)
    - Set boundaries (no support after 6 PM, weekends off)
    - Bring on co-founder or early employee at 20 clinics
    - Build systems and processes to reduce manual work
- [ ] **Risk 3: Payment collection issues (clinics don't pay on time)**
  - **Likelihood:** Medium (cash flow challenges in SMBs)
  - **Impact:** Medium (cash flow problems)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Require prepayment (monthly or quarterly)
    - Set up automated payment reminders (7 days, 3 days, 1 day before due)
    - Pause service automatically if payment is >5 days late
    - Offer annual prepayment discount (10% off) for better cash flow

### 7.4 Financial Risks

#### Risk Matrix
- [ ] **Risk 1: CAC is higher than expected (can't acquire clinics profitably)**
  - **Likelihood:** Medium (unproven sales motion)
  - **Impact:** High (burn through cash, can't scale)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Test multiple channels in Phase 4.1 to find lowest CAC
    - Set CAC ceiling (don't acquire if CAC >600 TND)
    - Focus on referrals and word-of-mouth (CAC = 0)
    - Improve conversion rates (better pitch, demo, onboarding)
- [ ] **Risk 2: Churn is higher than expected (clinics cancel after 3-6 months)**

  - **Impact:** High (LTV drops, unit economics break)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Track churn reasons via exit interviews
    - Proactively reach out to at-risk clinics (low usage, support issues)
    - Improve product based on feedback (reduce churn drivers)
    - Offer annual contracts with discount (locks in 12 months)
- [ ] **Risk 3: Runway runs out before reaching profitability**
  - **Likelihood:** Medium (bootstrapped, tight budget)
  - **Impact:** Critical (business dies)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Model cash flow conservatively (3 scenarios)
    - Raise small funding round (20,000 TND) if needed after pilot
    - Cut costs aggressively if behind on revenue targets
    - Have fallback plan (pause growth, focus on retaining existing clinics)

### 7.5 Regulatory & Legal Risks

#### Risk Matrix
- [ ] **Risk 1: Data privacy regulations (patient phone numbers)**
  - **Likelihood:** Low (Tunisia doesn't have strict GDPR-like laws yet)
  - **Impact:** Medium (if regulations change, compliance costs)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Implement data encryption for phone numbers
    - Create privacy policy and terms of service
    - Get patient consent via QR check-in flow
    - Monitor regulatory changes in Tunisia
- [ ] **Risk 2: Medical regulations (is queue management software regulated?)**
  - **Likelihood:** Low (not a medical device, just scheduling)
  - **Impact:** Low (likely minimal impact)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Research Tunisian medical software regulations
    - Consult with 1-2 lawyers (if needed)
    - Ensure clear disclaimer: "Not medical advice, just queue management"
- [ ] **Risk 3: Contractual disputes with clinics**
  - **Likelihood:** Low (clear contract, low price point)
  - **Impact:** Low (refund 1 month fee, move on)
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Use simple, clear contract (1-2 pages)
    - Include cancellation policy (30 days notice)
    - Offer satisfaction guarantee (refund first month if not happy)

#### Evidence Deliverable
- [ ] Create "Risk Register" (4-5 pages) with:

## Success Criteria: Solid Business Plan Achieved

Your business plan is **solid** when:

1. ✅ **Problem is validated** with quantitative data from 15-20 doctors and 50+ patients
2. ✅ **Solution is PROVEN** through pilot with YOUR COUSIN'S PRACTICE showing measurable impact (THIS IS YOUR SECRET WEAPON!)
3. ✅ **Market size is researched** with hard data (not guesses)
4. ✅ **Competition is understood** with honest assessment of strengths/weaknesses
5. ✅ **Pricing is justified** with customer willingness-to-pay data + YOUR COUSIN'S validation
6. ✅ **Unit economics work** with LTV:CAC > 3:1 and <12 month payback (CAC boosted by cousin's referrals)
7. ✅ **Financial projections are realistic** with conservative assumptions and REAL pilot data (not estimates!)
8. ✅ **GTM strategy is tactical** with specific channels, costs, timeline + COUSIN'S TESTIMONIAL as lead magnet
9. ✅ **Risks are identified and mitigated** with contingency plans
10. ✅ **Execution plan is clear** with week-by-week roadmap and milestones
11. ✅ **Team credibility is established** with relevant experience and advisors
12. ✅ **TRACTION IS DEMONSTRATED** with:
    - ✅ Working pilot with Dr. [Cousin's Name], Ophthalmology
    - ✅ Real before/after metrics (wait times, receptionist time, patient satisfaction)
    - ✅ Video testimonial from doctor + receptionist
    - ✅ 3-5 patient testimonials
    - ✅ 2-3 warm referrals ready to sign up
    - ✅ Proof that someone would pay 60 TND/month for this
